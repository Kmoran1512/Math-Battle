## Overview
  
  In Math Battle, your character leads an army of elemental minions into battle against each other. You hire the minions by paying them gold to join your side. In this game, you will be fighting a bot. 
  
## Goal
  
  The goal of the game is simple. You want all your opponents to lose their health while you have health remaining. 

## A Turn

  You start with three gold pieces at the beginning of the game, and with each turn, you will get gold equal to the turn you are at, but you will never have more than seven gold pieces.  So if you are at turn one, you will have three pieces. At the end of turn one, if you do not spend the gold, it goes away.  At the beginning of turn two, you receive another three and one for the turn for a total of four gold.  Turn three; you receive three gold plus two more for the turn for a total of five. Again, if you do not spend the gold, it will not carry forward to the next turn.<br/>
  Each turn is made up of three phases Buying and Selling, Battle, and Damage.

## Buying

 Once you have your gold for the turn, you can buy any minion you want for the level of that minion. For example, a level one minion would cost one gold. If you're going to sell a minion first, you pick the minion to confirm. Selling a minion would then give you half the gold. If you bought a minion for an odd number like three, you would get half the gold rounded down, so one gold would be the refunded amount. You can only command seven minions at once, so selling minions that aren't as strong as others is a good strategy.<br/>
  If you don't want to purchase any minions, you can wait for a new buying round, and the store will refresh. At the first turn, level one minions are available. At each turn, another level of the store is open, and there are seven store levels. 


## Attack

  After the Buying and Selling phase is over within each turn, the battle begins. You face off in a one-v-one against a random opponent (bot) until only one player's minions remain.<br/>
  This phase is entirely automated, so your minions do all the battling without input. The minions fight the minion in front of it. If there is not a full board, then it will take the first minion in line. 

## Block

  Once there is a winner in the battle, the block phase starts. The loser adds up the total amount of damage caused by the minion bots and then gets to pick a number that's divisible by the totalâ€”for example, if the damage amounts to 12 then the loser gets to pick a number that divides into 12 in a range between 1 through 9. Choosing a number, such as six, will stop that much of the damage if it is divisible by the total. The damage total is reduced by six. If the amount of damage is a prime number, then there is plus-five damage to the attack. But, a person can stop that if they pick one. Then once a player's health is reduced to zero, they are out of the game, and they have to start a new game.

## Minions

  There are many powerful minions all grouped into three categories: Fire, Water, and Grass. The Fire minions focus on attack and do extra damage to grass minions. Water minions are defensive and have a bonus when fighting a fire. Grass minions are well rounded and do more damage when fighting against water minions.<br/>
  There are new and exciting minions in all elements at each level, each more powerful than the last. For a full list of the minions, go to the compendium section of Math-Battle's website once you have signed in.
