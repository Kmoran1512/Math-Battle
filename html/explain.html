            <h1>How to Play: Math Battle!</h1>
            
                <h2>Overview</h2>

                    <p>In Math Battle, your character leads an army of elemental minions into battle against each other. You hire the minions by paying them gold to join your side. You have seven opponents, and you will face in a one-versus-one battle every turn.</p>

                <h2>Goal</h2>

                    <p>The goal of the game is simple. You want to be the last one standing, after all of your opponents have lost their health.</p>

                <h2>A Turn</h2>

                    <p>Each turn begins with your gold cap increasing by one (if you had 3 gold last turn, then this turn you will have four). However, you can never have more than 10 gold, and any gold you don't use this turn wont cary over to next turn.</p>
                    <p>Each turn is made up of three phases Buying and Selling, Battle, and Damage.</p>

                <h3>Buying and Selling</h3>

                    <p>Once you have your gold for the turn you can buy any minion you want for 3 gold, and if you have a minion that you no longer want you can sell it for one gold. You can only command seven minions at once, so selling minions that aren't as strong as some that you can buy is not a bad idea.</p>
                    <p>If you don't want to buy any minions, instead you can buy a new level. The first turn a level is available it costs the same as the level number, but the start of every turn also reduces the cost by one. Not only does leveling up mean you'll do more damage when you win a fight, but you can also hire stronger minions to fight for your team.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, you only have one minute in this phase so use your time wisely.

                <h3>Battle</h3>

                    <p>After the Buying and Selling phase is over the battle begins. You face-off in a one-v-one against a random opponent until only one players minions remain.
                    <p>This phase is completely automated and random, so your minions will take care of all of the battling for you.

                <h3>Damage</h3>

                    <p>Once there is a winner in the battle the loser takes damage equal to the number of minions the winner still has plus the level of the winner. Once a player's health is reduced to zero they are out of the game and they have to start a new game.</p>

                <h2>Minions</h2>

                    <p>There are many powerful minions all grouped into three catagories: Fire, Water, and Grass. The Fire minions focus on attack, and do extra damage to grass minions. Water minions are defensive, and have a bonus when fighting fire. Grass minions are well rounded, and do more damage when fighting against water mininos.</p>
                    <p>There are new and exciting minions in all element each more powerful than the last. For a full list of the minions go to the compendium section of Math-Battle's website <button type="button" class="btn btn-link" onclick="location.href='compendium.html'">Here!</button>.</p>
