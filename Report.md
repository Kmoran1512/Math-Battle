Math Battle is a fun math-based game for kids elementary through high school, along with adults. The game is accessible for the blind through the use of a screen reader. The premise of the game is based on another free online game called Hearthstone Battlegrounds made by Blizzard. Hearthstone Battlegrounds is a card-based auto-battler game using primarily visual cues to guide players. However, Math battle takes the concept of Hearthstone further by adding features that are not in Battlegrounds to make it accessible. But first, we’ll review how to play the game. <br/>

Math Battle has three separate phases, Recruit, Attack, and Block. During the various stages, different things occur. In the Recruit phase, you start the process by buying and selling minions. The Attack phase is where the minions attack an opponent, in this case, controlled by the computer. During the Attack phase, the various minions offer different advantages over the opponents. There are three different types of minions: fire, grass, and water. The fire minions have an advantage against grass but not water. Grass has an advantage against water but not fire. Water has an advantage against fire but not grass. Minions that face-off with opponents that have an advantage against them will sustain twice the amount of damage. Lastly, in the block phase, you can stop some of the damage you would take if you did not win the attack phase based on whether you correctly chose a divisor of the damage. The idea of the game is to have the Player develop skills in math that include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the recognition of prime numbers. <br />  
The Buying and Attack phases help the player to develop skills with addition and subtraction. During the Attack and Block phases, players learn multiplication and division. The idea of the game is to teach math to the blind by still being able to play the game through audio cues. This is achieved by using key combinations, so that anyone with a keyboard can play the game whether or not they can see. We operated with the assumption that the player is able to hold down two keys at once since in order to use the screen reader we were designing for, NVDA, you are required to hold down a key to input several of the commands. If the user is unable to hold down keys then they likely use another setting to emulate it, so by that assumption we should be okay to require a combination of keys in order to make the game more accessible to the blind. For our combination keys we chose the control and alt keys, the reason for choosing these keys is that NVDA uses the standard keyboard and alt keys for several shortcuts like “H” to find the next header or “L” to find the next list, so we needed another way to differentiate keys. Control and Alt are individually both used by the browser, so we settled on both Control and Alt, since there are a lot controls bound to those keys. Using the standards listed on MDN we also assigned a tabindex to the image of each of our cards so they could be interacted with as if they were buttons. The hot keys themself are as follows (each of these exclude the ctrl + alt combination to use them):

+ Enter Key: Selects the minion that has been highlighted by the tab key.
+ A. Key: During the Recruit phase this hot-key will refresh the buy-board.
+ S. Key: Progresses to the next phase, this can be used during the Recruit phase after you are done buying and selling minions and refreshing the buy-board, and this can be used in the Block phase after you have selected a shield.
+ D. Key: During the Recruit phase when a minion is selected either by using the Enter hot-key or by using a mouse this hot-key will either sell or buy a minions depending on if you control it or if it is in the buy-board.
+ F. Key: During the Recruit phase if you have four coins pressing this hot-key will level you up then read out your new level.
+ G. Key: During the Recruit phase this hot-key will read out what minions you have on your board.
+ H. Key: During the Recruit or Block phase this hot-key will read out what minions your opponent has on their board.
+ I. Key: During the Recruit or Block phase this hot-key will read out what round number you are currently on.
+ J. Key: During the Recruit or Block phase this hot-key will read out what level you are currently on.
+ K. Key: During the Recruit or Block phase this hot-key will read out how many coins you currently have.
+ L. Key: During the Recruit or Block phase this hot-key will read out how much health remaining you currently have.
+ B. Key: If at anytime in the game you need help remembering these hot-keys using ctrl + alt + the B key will read out what each one is and what they do to help you remember. <br/>

## But why create the game?

All of the people within our game development team have played different card-based games that require visuals. Because our team enjoys computer-based card games, we had the idea to make the game more accessible to those visually impaired. The games we enjoy would not work for those that cannot see the board on the computer screen. So, we changed aspects of the game that would make it accessible to those with and without sight by adding elements that would read vital game information. However, we wanted to retain a visually appealing site, because the social aspect of games like this is important for the development of children, and we wanted the visually impared to be able to play the same game as their sighted friends and both enjoy it, while both developing math skills! <br />
The only hardware technology used for this game is a computer and a router that provides internet access. At this time, the game can only be played on a computer and is not accessible on a mobile platform such as a smartphone or tablet. The libraries used to provide the function for the game are Bootstrap CSS, Google’s Firebase authentication for handling user logins, and Wep Speech API’s SpeechSynthesis library for speaking information about the game to the user. The only complete framework we leveraged was JQuery. The sound library website provides audio cues for the animation. All of the cards and animations are custom made for the game. For creating the images and animations, we used the following programs; Premiere, Photoshop, Animate, and Microsoft Paint. A combination of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML creates the game. The game is built on a static website run on GitHub Pages that is updated to show the different level progressions. <br />
The coding within the game creates the opponent bot when advancing through rounds. As the rounds continue, the bot will pick higher levels of minions that correspond with that round/phase of the game. So, for every two rounds, the opponent bot increases both its level and the number of minions the player is facing by one additional minion, up to a maximum amount of seven. The minions have levels ranging from one to seven. Every two rounds the opponent bot selects from the next level of minion. After 14 rounds, the bot will not pick any additional minions from the level-one pool. Then at the 16th round, the bot cannot pick any further level 2 minions. This progression continues until the opponent bot reaches the max minion level of seven. <br />
Some of the main problems were game accessibility by having the audio updates during any round of the game and browsers support. At times the screen reader would not function requiring a restart and review of the code. While the visual progression would work, the audio would not work at all making this part the most challenging aspect to function correctly. There were also problems visually with different monitors. At the start there were some image issues where the img would overflow and repeat. Now the problems are with the text overflowing the borders based on different screen sizes. It also took time to figure out that the different browsers were not supported with the game. <br />
In the future, one update for the game would be for it to work on all browsers. For the best experience, the game requires a Chrome browser and the screen reader NVDA, playing on Mozilla Firefox proved incompatible. Also, we had the original ideas of making this a multiplayer game. However, both time constraints, and that we would have a low daily number active users, meaning that someone could be waiting a long time in a queue just to play the game led us to focus on the single-player aspect. We would need additional time to make this multiplayer. Additional future changes would include better artwork and audio cues, including different voices. The development of this game, and making it accessible, has been a learning experience for the whole team, and we hope that you enjoy the game! <br />
